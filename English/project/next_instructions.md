# 📈 Advancing Capstone Projects

At this stage of the course, you probably already know what project you're passionate about and want to spend the next few weeks actualising. In this write-up, you'll learn more about how to **break the solution to the problem you previously framed into pieces** you can code, how to **use appropriate concepts** effectively, and how to use the **collective power of other fellow course participants** to perfect your solution and find other more creative or easier ways to approach the challenge. 

## 🧩 How do I break down my solution into programmable pieces?
A general rule of the thumb is that if parts of your solution cannot be taken out of the whole project and tested independently, it can still be broken down into smaller pieces. Here are some questions you could use to define clear, programmable steps:

1) In what ways does a user **interact** with your solution?

2) In what ways does data **flow** through your solution?
    1) What decisions does your solution need to make? (&rarr; conditionals)
    2) What tasks does your solution repeat? (&rarr; loops)
    3) What information does your solution need to remember? (&rarr; variables)
    4) What do I want to be able to do with my data? (&rarr; data structures)
    5) What outside resources does your solution need? (&rarr; files)

3) What can **go wrong** in your solution as is?

4) What do you want your solution to **output**?



## 🗺️ How do I know what concepts to use?
At this point of the course, you have a solid overview of how to code in Python, well done! In order to most effectively bridge theory and implementation, you could 

1) The **bottom-up approach**: What do I want my solution to *do* at various stages of implementation and how can the concepts I've seen throughout the course help me get there?

2) The **top-down approach**: What concepts do I *remember* from the course and how can I employ them in order to build the solution I envisioned? (If a concept stood out to you, it was probably because you considered it handy before!)

3) The **drawing approach**: Can I *map* out visually how data (big data or even just individual variables) flows through the skeleton of my solution?

## 👥 How do I get the most out of group feedback?
You'll have an amazing opportunity to discuss your project with other fellow course participants, so make sure to **come prepared** to make sure the seession is as beneficial as possible for everyone. In order to prepare for the discussion, you could answer the following questions:
1) **What are you building?** What is the core problem your project solves in one sentence? What is the current status of your project? (What works? What doesn't?) What is your next immediate step?

2) **What are you uncertain about?** What design decision are you uncertain about? What trade-offs are you considering? (e.g., simplicity vs. features, speed vs. accuracy)

3) **Where are you stuck?** What specific challenge are you stuck on right now? What challenge do you expect to be stuck on throughout the project? What have you already tried to solve this challenge? What do you think you could use but haven't tried yet? (Do you think it will work? Why? Why not?)

4) **What could help others?** What part of your project are you most proud of? What would have saved you time if you'd known it earlier? What resource or approach was particularly helpful? What tip would you give someone starting a similar project?

## 🎯 How will my project be assessed?
The *necessary condition* for your solution to receive a passing grade is that must be **functional** (no compilation errors, the output must represent what you say it represents). In addition to that, you will be assessed on the following criteria:
1) **Problem Decomposition** (30%): 

    1) How well was the problem broken down into manageable pieces? 
    2) Are technical choices (data structures, algorithms, libraries, etc.) justified and appropriate?
    3) Does your code avoid unnecessary repetition? (e.g., using loops or functions instead of copy-pasting the same blocks over and over again)

2) **Error-Handling** (20%): 

    1) Do you show awareness of things that could go wrong as user interacts with your solution?
    2) Have you paid attention to acknowledging and handling this error?
    3) Can you show your solution is working well using tests or print statements?

3) **Documentation** (20%): 
    1) How well does your documentation explain what your project does as a whole and what concepts were applied?
    2) How well does your documentation explain what your solution does at each individual step?
    3) Is your documentation brief and informative (rather than overly wordy or vague)?

4) **Presentation** (10%):
    1) Did you successfully post your solution on GitHub?
    2) Is your solution easily accessible do an external user? (Would a stranger who comes across your repository know what to do with it?)
    3) Does your solution present output in a neat and effective way (e.g., using appropriate intuitive labels, formatting, or visuals)?

5) **Self-Assessment** (20%): 
    1) How has completing this project changed your understanding of the subject matter compared to when you started? What specific skills did you gain?
    2) Were there any concepts or techniques you struggled to implement? How did this struggle inform your final solution?
    3) What additional features or improvements would you add if you had more time or other resources?

You can also receive BONUS POINTS for the following bonus criteria (if you describe how you demonstrated any of them in your documentation): 
- **Creativity** (5%): Does the solution show original thinking or clever approaches? Did you develop a solution that maybe not everyone would have thought of?

- **Collaboration** (5%): Did you ask for help from fellow course participants using the course platforms? Did you implement feedback? Did you maybe meet with others to discuss and/or collaborate on projects?

- **Curiosity** (5%): Did a part of your solution include a strategy we have not covered on the course? Did you run the extra mile to learn about a strategy from an external sources and applied this strategy successfully?
