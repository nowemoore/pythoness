# üß© Thinking about Capstone Projects

You're entering the a stage of the course, where you'll experience a **shift from "I learned some Python concepts" to "I can identify a problem and use Python concepts to solve them"**. Here's some good news for you: almost every problem out there can become a programming problem!

## ü§î What Counts as a Problem?
The world is full of problems! **"Problem" doesn't mean something is necessarily wrong**&mdash;it can also mean  "something to figure out" or "a question to answer". Problems exist whenever there's a gap between how things are and how you'd like them to be.

## üíª What is a Programming Problem?
A real-world problem becomes a programming problem when you can **break it down into steps** that a computer can execute (loops, logical operations, data structures, functions, tables) and use them to generate a solution (or a partial solution). Remember that there are still 3 weeks of content ahead of you, so don't limit yourself to conecpts you know when thinking of how to implement a solution using Python just yet!

## üîç How Do I Find a Problem of My Own?
It's always a good start to simply notice what's happening in the world around you. Now many of the problems around us are obviously too large to describe, leave alone program a solution to, so my recommendation would be: **Start Small**. Pick a question you can start solving today, elaborate later. 

Here are some introspective questions you can answer for yourself to arrive at a problem like that:

1) What information do you keep track of or collect regularly (e.g. money spent, hours studied, songs listened to)?
2) If I could see one thing about my life visualized as a chart, what would it be?
3) When did you last think "I wish someone would count/sort/organize this for me"?


## üí° Problems For Inspiration
Below are some examples of what a problem can look like. (Un)fortunately, you'll have to come up with a problem of your own to complete the course!üôÇ

1) **Guess a Number Game**: The program randomly selects a number between 1-100. User has 7 attempts to guess it. After each guess, the program gives hints ("too high" or "too low"). The program tracks remaining guesses and displays them after each attempt. If the user guesses correctly, they win and see how many tries it took. If they run out of guesses, they lose and the program reveals the number. At the end, the program asks if they want to play again.

2) **Budget Cracker:** Every time a user wants to buy something, this program will check if they already have this item at home first. If the item is more expensive than a pre-set threshold, the program will ask a series of questions to decide if the user should buy it. If the item is outside of the user's budget, the program will simply not let them buy the item.

3) **Simple To-Do List Manager**: User can add tasks, mark tasks complete, view all tasks, or view only incomplete tasks. Every task has an expected time needed to complete and a deadline. Some tasks are just like normal tasks but will migrate to the top of the to-do lists (i.e. Priority Tasks). The user is able to enter a number of minutes they have at any given time and the programme will present a list of tasks they should do based on their length and priority.

4) **Subscription Audit & Savings Calculator**: User inputs all subscriptions (streaming, gym, apps, etc.) with monthly cost and usage frequency. Program calculates yearly cost, cost per actual use, and identifies "zombie subscriptions" unused in 30+ days. Asks decision questions: "You spent $15 but used it 0 times last month - cancel?" Shows potential yearly savings from cancellations.

5) **Coffee Budget Tracker**: User sets a monthly coffee budget (e.g., $60). Every time they buy coffee, they input the price and the program subtracts it from their remaining budget. The program tracks how many coffees they've bought, calculates average price per coffee, and shows how many days left in the month. If they're spending too fast, it warns them ("At this rate, you'll run out by day 20!"). If budget runs out, program calculates how much they overspent and suggests how to adjust the type of coffee and the frequency of visiting coffee shops the user should adopt next month.
