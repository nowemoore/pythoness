# Advanced Problems

## ⭐ Task 01
Create a `Projectile` class with initial velocity and angle. Implement methods `get_position(time)` that returns a tuple of `x` and `y` coordinates at time `t`. Them implement the `get_max_height()`, `get_range()`, and `time_to_ground()` methods. Use physics equations to make this work.

## ⭐ Task 02
Create `Card` and `Deck` classes. `Card` has suit, rank, and value. `Deck` has 52 cards. Implement Deck methods `shuffle()`, `deal(n)`, `draw()`, `cards_remaining()`, `has_card()` and `sort_by_value()`. Create a simple game: deal 5 cards to 3 players, determine who has the highest total value.

## ⭐ Task 03
Create a program that simulates a simple traffic light system. The light cycles through green (30 seconds), yellow (5 seconds), and red (25 seconds). Given a time in seconds since the light turned green, determine what color the light currently shows. Use if/elif/else statements and handle multiple complete cycles. (Use Python's [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) library to keep track of time.)
