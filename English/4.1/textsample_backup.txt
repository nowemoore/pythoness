CINNAMON ROLLS: A QUICK GUIDE

MAKING GREAT CINNAMON ROLLS IS ABOUT RESPECTING THE YEAST AND THE BUTTER. THIS GUIDE FOCUSES ON EFFICIENCY FOR A PERFECTLY GOOEY RESULT.

1. THE DOUGH (ACTIVE TIME: APPROX 15 MIN)

START BY ACTIVATING YOUR YEAST (2.25 TSP) IN 1/4 CUP OF WARM WATER WITH A PINCH OF SUGAR. WHILE IT FOAMS, GENTLY MELT 1/4 CUP OF BUTTER INTO 1 CUP OF MILK, THEN COOL IT SLIGHTLY BEFORE STIRRING IN 1/4 TSP OF SALT. NOW, COMBINE THE YEAST MIXTURE, THE MILK MIXTURE, AND 1 LARGE EGG IN A LARGE BOWL. GRADUALLY ADD 3 TO 3.5 CUPS OF FLOUR UNTIL A SOFT DOUGH FORMS. KNEAD IT FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES UNTIL SMOOTH, THEN LET IT RISE IN AN OILED BOWL FOR 1 HOUR.

2. THE FILLING & ASSEMBLY (ACTIVE TIME: APPROX 10 MIN)

ONCE THE DOUGH HAS DOUBLED, PUNCH IT DOWN AND ROLL IT INTO A LARGE RECTANGLE (AROUND 12 IN X 18 IN). SPREAD 1/2 CUP OF SOFT BUTTER EVENLY ACROSS THE SURFACE. IN A SEPARATE BOWL, MIX 1 CUP OF PACKED BROWN SUGAR WITH 2 TABLESPOONS OF CINNAMON, AND SPRINKLE THIS RICH MIXTURE OVER THE BUTTER. ROLL THE DOUGH UP TIGHTLY FROM THE LONG EDGE INTO A CYLINDER. SLICE THIS LOG INTO 12 ROLLS AND PLACE THEM CUT-SIDE UP IN A GREASED 9 IN X 13 IN BAKING DISH. COVER AND LET THEM RISE ONE LAST TIME FOR 30 MINUTES.

3. BAKE AND FROST (TOTAL TIME: APPROX 30 MIN)

PREHEAT YOUR OVEN TO 375Â°F AND BAKE THE ROLLS FOR 20 TO 25 MINUTES UNTIL THEY ARE LIGHTLY GOLDEN BROWN. AS THEY COOL SLIGHTLY, PREPARE THE FROSTING: SIMPLY BEAT TOGETHER 4 OZ OF SOFT CREAM CHEESE, 2 TBSP OF SOFT BUTTER, 1.5 CUPS OF POWDERED SUGAR, AND 1/2 TSP OF VANILLA. ADD A TABLESPOON OR TWO OF MILK UNTIL THE DESIRED FLUFFY CONSISTENCY IS REACHED. SLATHER THE WARM ROLLS GENEROUSLY WITH THE CREAM CHEESE FROSTING.

ENJOY YOUR INCREDIBLY SOFT AND CINNAMON-LACED FINAL PRODUCT!
