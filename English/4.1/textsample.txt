CINNAMON ROLLS: A QUICK GUIDE

Making great cinnamon rolls is about respecting the yeast and the butter. This guide focuses on efficiency for a perfectly gooey result.

1. THE DOUGH (Active Time: approx 15 min)

Start by activating your yeast (2.25 tsp) in 1/4 cup of warm water with a pinch of sugar. While it foams, gently melt 1/4 cup of butter into 1 cup of milk, then cool it slightly before stirring in 1/4 tsp of salt. Now, combine the yeast mixture, the milk mixture, and 1 large egg in a large bowl. Gradually add 3 to 3.5 cups of flour until a soft dough forms. Knead it for about 5 minutes until smooth, then let it rise in an oiled bowl for 1 hour.

2. THE FILLING & ASSEMBLY (Active Time: approx 10 min)

Once the dough has doubled, punch it down and roll it into a large rectangle (around 12 in x 18 in). Spread 1/2 cup of soft butter evenly across the surface. In a separate bowl, mix 1 cup of packed brown sugar with 2 tablespoons of cinnamon, and sprinkle this rich mixture over the butter. Roll the dough up tightly from the long edge into a cylinder. Slice this log into 12 rolls and place them cut-side up in a greased 9 in x 13 in baking dish. Cover and let them rise one last time for 30 minutes.

3. BAKE AND FROST (Total Time: approx 30 min)

Preheat your oven to 375Â°F and bake the rolls for 20 to 25 minutes until they are lightly golden brown. As they cool slightly, prepare the frosting: simply beat together 4 oz of soft cream cheese, 2 Tbsp of soft butter, 1.5 cups of powdered sugar, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Add a tablespoon or two of milk until the desired fluffy consistency is reached. Slather the warm rolls generously with the cream cheese frosting.

Enjoy your incredibly soft and cinnamon-laced final product!
