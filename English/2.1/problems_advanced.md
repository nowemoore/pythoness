# Advanced Problems

## ⭐ **Task 01**
Create a function `k_closest_points()` that takes in the `x` and `y` coordinates of a 2D plane finds the distance to the origin.

## ⭐ **Task 02**
Write a function `roman_to_int()` that converts Roman numerals to integers. 

## ⭐ **Task 03**
Write a function `word_break()` that takes in a word and a dictionary of words and returns True if the provided word can be segmented into dictionary words (e.g. if the input string is `butterfly` and the input dictionary contains `butter` and `fly`, the function should yield `True`).

## ⭐ **Task 04**
Create a function `spiral_matrix()` that takes in an integer `n` and generates an n*n matrix (i.e. a list of lists of numbers) filled with numbers 1 to n^2 in spiral order (starting in the middle).

## ⭐ **Task 05**
Create a function `matrix_rotation()` that takes in a matrix and an integer `k` and rotates this matrix 90 degrees clockwise k times.

## ⭐ **Task 06**
Write a function `binary_to_decimal()` that takes in a decimal value and returns its binary equivalent. (Learn how to convert decimals to binary numbers [here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zd88jty/revision/3).)

## ⭐ **Task 07**
Write a function `next_permutation(nums)` that takes in an integer composed of at least two digits and returns the next permutation of its digits in the ascending order. If no such permutation exists, return the smallest permutation of its digits.

## ⭐ **Task 08**
Create a function `valid_sudoku()` that takes in a 9*9 matrix representing a Sudoku board and returns `True` if the board is valid according to Sudoku rules. (Represent empty cells by '-1'.)

## ⭐ **Task 09**
Write a function `word_lchange`(begin_word, end_word, word_list) that finds the shortest transformation sequence from `begin_word` to `end_word` where each transformation changes exactly one letter and each intermediate word must exist in `word_list`.

## ⭐ **Task 10**
Write a function `compress_string(s)` that takes in a string of lowercase letters and returns a string with every unique character in a sequence followed by the number of times this character occurs (e.g. returns `"a3b2c4"` for the input of `"aaabbcccc"`).
