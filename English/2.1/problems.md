# In-Class Problems

## ⭐ **Task 01**
Write a function `greet()` that takes in a name as an argument and prints `"Hello, [name]!"`. Test it with your own name.

## ⭐ **Task 02**
Write a function `greet_everyone()` that takes in a list of names and prints `"Hello, [name]!"` for all names on the list. The number of names is not specified ahead of time.

## ⭐ **Task 03**
Write a function `area()` that takes in every _unique_ lenght of a right-angled symmetric quadrilateral and returns its area.

## ⭐ **Task 04**
Write a function `fibonacci()` that takes in an interger `n` and returns the `n`th fibonacci number.

## ⭐ **Task 05**
Create a recursive function `gcd()` that finds and returns the greatest common divisor of any two input integers. (Hint: consider using Euclid's algorithm.)

## ⭐ **Task 06**
Create a function `validate_email()` that returns `True` iff an input string contains exactly one @, at least one dot after @, and no spaces. 

## ⭐ **Task 07**
Write a function `anagram_groups()` that considers a list of words and returns a dictionary of anagrams, where the key is the alphabetical representative (e.g. `{"aet": ["eat", "tea", "ate"], "ab": ["tab", "bat"]}`).

## ⭐ **Task 08**
Create a function `names_alphabetical()` that takes in a person's name (you don't know how many middle names they provide) and returns all parts of their name in the alphabetic order.

## ⭐ **Task 09**
Write a function `reverse()` that takes in a string and returns the string reversed.

## ⭐ **Task 10**
Create a function `word_count()` that takes in a string with a sentence and returns a dictionary with each word as a key and its frequency as the value.

## ⭐ **Task 10**
Write a function `prime_check()` that takes in an integer and returns True if the number is prime, False otherwise. (Hint: make sure to handle negative numbers and other edge cases.)

## ⭐ **Task 11**
Create a function `merge_lists(`) that takes in exactly two sorted lists of integers and returns a single sorted list containing all elements from both list.

## ⭐ **Task 12**
Create a function `find_common_elements()` that takes in two lists and returns a list of elements that appear in both lists.

## ⭐ **Task 13**
Create a function `ceasar_cipher()` that takes in a string and an integer `n`, and returns the string shifted by n positions to the left. (Hint: handle cases where n is larger than string length.)

## ⭐ **Task 14**
Write a function `find_second_largest()` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the second largest number. (Hint: handle a list of all values equal.)

## ⭐ **Task 15**
Create a function `count_words_by_length()` that takes in a sentence and returns a dictionary where keys are word lengths and values are counts of words with that length.

## ⭐ **Task 16**
Write a function `find_missing_number()` that takes in a list of integers from 1 to n with one number missing, and returns the missing number. The list is not necessarily sorted.

## ⭐ **Task 17**
Write a function `remove_nth_character()` that takes in a string and an integer n, and returns the string with every nth character removed. Handle cases where n is larger than string length.

## ⭐ **Task 18**
Create a function `sort_by_frequency()` that takes in a list of elements and returns a list sorted by frequency of occurrence (most frequent first). (Hint: think about how you want to deal with ties.)

## ⭐ **Task 19**
Create a function `leap_year_check()` that takes in a year and returns True if it's a leap year. 

## ⭐ **Task 19**
Create a function `hours_to_hms()` that takes in a decimal number of hours and converts it to hours:minutes:seconds format.
