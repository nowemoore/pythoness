# In-Class Problems

## ⭐ **Task 01**
Use control flows to print your name exactly 11 times.

## ⭐ **Task 02**
Use control flows to print every multiple of 3 between 2 and 22.

## ⭐ **Task 03**
Create a variable score between 0 and 100. Use control flows to assign a letter grade (A: 90-100, B: 80-89, C: 70-79, D: 60-69, F: below 60).

## ⭐ **Task 04**
Create a list with 5 different colours. Create a boolean variable `has_red` that yields True if the list contains red, False otherwise. Print the result.

## ⭐ **Task 05**
Make a list of boolean values representing quiz answers. Calculate and print the percentage of True answers.

## ⭐ **Task 06**
Create a list of floating-point numbers. Modify the list so that every number is rounded up to 2 decimal places.

## ⭐ **Task 07**
Create a set with numbers 1-20. Remove all numbers divisible by 4 and print the remaining set.

## ⭐ **Task 08**
Create two sets, `a` and `b`, with 7 numerical values between 0 and 9 each. Now create a set `c` that contains values of `a` without the values that also occur in `b`. (Hint: Recall [set operations](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets_methods.asp).)

## ⭐ **Task 09**
Create a variable `day_idx` with a value between 1 and 365. Use control flows to determine which day of the week it is. (Hint: Consider using the modulo operator to find the pattern.)

## ⭐ **Task 10**
Create a list of strings representing file names (include endings like `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.jpg`, `.docx` etc.). Use iterators to filter out strings not representing text files and print the result.

## ⭐ **Task 11**
Create a list of 10 random integers. Find the second largest number.

## ⭐ **Task 12**
Create a list of dictionaries, each representing a person with name and age. Calculate the average age.

## ⭐ **Task 13**
Create a list of 12 random names. Split these names into triplets alphabetically and print the result as a list.

## ⭐ **Task 14**
Use control flows to find the result of 63487 divided by 7. No division or multiplication operators!

## ⭐ **Task 15**
Everyone create a list of 10 colours in your respective repositories. Then merge your lists into one repository using GitHub (not manually) and find their intersection.
