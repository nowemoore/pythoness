# In-Class Problems: Advanced

## ⭐ **Task 01**
Create a list with mixed data types (strings, numbers, booleans). Sort them into separate lists by type and print the new lists.

## ⭐ **Task 02**
Create a dictionary with city names and populations. Find all cities with population over 1 million.

## ⭐ **Task 03**
Create a tuple representing RGB colour values (0-255). Determine if it represents a shade of grey (all values equal).

## ⭐ **Task 04**
Let's define `matrix` as a list of lists containing an equal number of items of the same type. Create a few sample lists of lists and use control flows to determine whether or not they are matrices.

## ⭐ **Task 05**
Consider the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 7]`. Get rid of all duplicates without control flows. Print the number of duplicates. (Hint: Consider using [data casting](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_casting.asp).)

## ⭐ **Task 06**
Make a set of 10 random names. Use control flows to find all names that contain the letter `a`.

## ⭐ **Task 07**
Make a list of random integers between 1 and 50. Find out how many are primes and print the result.

## ⭐ **Task 08**
Create a string with your full name. Extract and print your initials.

## ⭐ **Task 09**
Create two lists of 7 random numbers between 0 and 9. Print a dictionary holding their union, intersection, and symmetric difference.

## ⭐ **Task 10**
Make a list of 0s and 1s in a random order. Then use control flows to count the number of islands (connected groups of the same numbers). Print the result.
