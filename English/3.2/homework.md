# Homework Assignment 3.2

### 📆 Due Date: before class on 4/11/2025

### 🎯 Instructions: Part I

Revise the following statistical terms. Make yourself comfortable describing each term in your own words:
- *median*
- *mean*
- *standard deviation*
- *mode*
- *percentile*

### 🎯 Instructions: Part II
Explore what the `groupby` method in Python does. Focus on the parameters and output (i.e. what you as a programmer can specify in arguments and what the desired outcome is), no need to understand the specifics of [dataframes](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_dataframes.asp) and [pandas](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp) just yet. Tip: A good thing to understand is what an [aggregation function](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.08-aggregation-and-grouping.html) is.
