### ðŸ“† Due Date: before class on 11/11/2025


### ðŸŽ¯ Instructions: 

1) Pick a dataset on Kaggle and download it through your local Terminal.
2) Convert the `.csv` file to a dataframe using `pandas`.
3) Use `pandas` methods (refer to materials in 4.1) to explore your file. Here are some ideas:
    - create a new column with modified data from a different column
    - sort your table by data in a selected column
    - calculate the average (mean) value for a numeric column
    - filter the table to show only rows where values in a column equal a specific value
    - count how many unique groups exist in a categorical column
    - retrieve the value of a specific cell using its row and column index
4) Use `plotly` (refer to materials in 4.2) to visualise your data.
